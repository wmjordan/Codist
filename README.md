## Advanced C# Syntax Highlight

The advanced syntax highlight function highlights every aspect of C# language elements with diverse styles, including using various font families and text styles, underline styles, enlarging or shrinking font sizes, changing foreground or background colors and transparency.

You can change syntax highlight styles in any languages, such as Visual BASIC, F#, SASS, and so on, even if they are not recognized by Codist.

The following screenshots of the `TestPage.cs` file in the source code project demonstrates possible syntax highlight effects in the Light theme.

  ![Syntax highlight](doc/highlight1.png) 

* The font size of type and member declarations can be enlarged, font families are also changeable, so it is much easier to spot them.
* Syntax highlight can be applied to braces and parentheses.
* Various syntax identifiers have different styles, temporary elements such as method parameters and local variables are italic, `static` symbols are underlined.
* Comment content can be tagged (e.g. _note_) and highlighted with individual style.
* Unnecessary code can be marked strike-through.
* Keywords are categorized and highlighted with various styles (e.g. `abstract` and `sealed`, `return` and `throw`, etc.).
* Overriding members (such as `ToString`) can be painted with gradient background color, so at a glance we know that the marked implementations have overridden their base classes.
* Imported symbols (from external assemblies, e.g. `NotImplementedException`, `ToString`) can be marked with a different style (bold here), distinguishing from symbols defined in your code.
* All the above styles are customizable.

### Default Syntax Highlight Themes

To quickly get started with advanced syntax highlight, open a C# project, then click the _Customize Codist Syntax Highlighting_ command under the _Tools_ menu.

A window will pop up, click buttons at the left side of the dialog under the **Predefined themes** and see changes in effect. The styles on the right of the dialog immediately lists effects of corresponding syntax elements. Don't forget to click the *Save* button at the bottom of the dialog to confirm the changes.

  ![Load Theme](doc/syntax-highlight-customization-window.png)

With the **Save** and **Load** buttons, you can backup and share your own syntax highlight settings.

If you mess up your syntax highlight styles, you can press the **Reset** button to reset all settings to default, or reapply predefined themes by clicking buttons at the left bottom.

**Note**: There is a known issue in _Codist_ that **if you change the theme of Visual Studio, you may have to restart it to make syntax highlight settings to work properly**. If the **Reset** button does not work, please try restarting Visual Studio.

### Customization of Syntax Highlight Styles

To customize and tweak the desired syntax highlight styles, click or select the text in the document window, and click the _Customize Codist Syntax Highlighting_ command under the _Tools_ menu.

The customization window will pop up and listing syntax classifications applied to the active text.

  ![Syntax Highlight Customizing Selected](doc/syntax-highlight-customizing-selected.png)

  Click the style in the Syntax Styles list, adjustment controls will be displayed at the bottom of the dialog, where you can change the style. As you change the style, you can immediately see how it appears in the code document window.

  ![Syntax Highlight Customization Preview](doc/syntax-highlight-customization-preview.png)

  Underline styles can be customized. Firstly assign a color for the **Line**, afterwards, more configuration elements will appear.

If you want to change another syntax element, click on the place where it is applied in the code document window. If the customization window is still opened, and the _Selected Code_ section under _Syntax Categories_ is selected, the list will display the corresponding syntax styles for the place you clicked immediately.

You can explore other syntax categories by clicking the list on the left of the dialog.

Syntax definitions in the _All languages_ section will list all syntax styles for any languages installed; those under _Tagged comments_ section apply to [comment taggers](#comment-tagger-and-styles), others apply to corresponding languages accordingly.

**Note**: _Font size_ is relative value to editor default font size. Partially checked checkboxes denote default syntax styles are used.

**A Side Note for Editor Font**: You may consider substituting the font used by Visual Studio code editor with professionally designed fonts for programming, for instance, [IBM Plex Mono](https://github.com/IBM/plex), [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode), etc. Employing [MacType](https://github.com/snowie2000/mactype) can significantly enhance system-wide textual display quality, especially for Chinese, Japanese and Korean programmers.

### My Symbols and External Symbols

_Codist_ can identify symbols which are defined in your source C# code and which are imported from external assemblies. This feature is so unique that you may not find it elsewhere.

You can customize it in the *symbol markers* section under the *C#* section in the *Syntax Highlight Configurations* dialog. Style _C#: User symbol_ is used for symbols from your code, and _C#: Metadata symbol_ is used for symbols imported from external assemblies.

**Note**: some predefined themes have defined external symbols with **bold** style, as the above screenshot shows.

## Comment Tagger and Styles

* The comment tagger highlights comments to your specific styles, according to the first token inside the comment.
  
  Here are the effects how they are applied.
  
  ![Comment syntax highlight](doc/syntax-highlight-comments.png)
  
  To configure the comment tags, which identify comment types, click the *tags* section, under the *Tagged comments* section in the *Syntax Highlight Configurations* dialog, where you can add, remove or modify comment tags.
  
  ![Syntax Highlight Comment Tags](doc/syntax-highlight-comment-tags.png)
  
  To disable comment tagger, open the _Options_ dialog, find the _Codist/Syntax Highlight_ section and  uncheck the check box labeled _Enable comment tagger_ in the _Syntax Highlight_ option page.

## Super Quick Info

The quick info (the tool-tip shown when you hover your mouse pointer on your C# source code) can be enhanced by *Codist*.

### General Quick Info

To customize the *Super Quick Info*, adjust the settings in the options page.

![Super Quick Info Options](doc/super-quick-info-options.png)

  Options in the _General_ page apply to all code editor windows.

* **Hide Quick Info until Shift key is pressed**
  
  By default, _Quick Info_ appears when you hover your mouse over a symbol or syntax token in code editor. Some programmers think this behavior interferes their workflow. Checking this option will suppress the _Quick Info_ until Shift key is pressed.

* **Selection info**
  
  This option will show how many characters and lines in your selection (if your selection spans over multiple lines). So you don't have to count characters one by one.
  
  ![Super Quick Info Selection Length](doc/super-quick-info-selection-length.png)

* **Color info**
  
  This option enables you preview color values. It works for hex color values (such as `#00FF00`，`#33993300`), named colors (such as `Black`, `White`, etc.). The 12 sample blocks under color values list the color as the foreground or background against various gray scale colors to help designers to determine the best readability.
  
  ![Super Quick Info - Color](doc/super-quick-info-color.png)
  
  In C# code editor, Codist can also analyze system colors (such as `SystemColors.WindowColor`, `SystemColors.Control`, etc.), `Color.FromArgb` or `Color.FromRgb` expression with constant values as well.
  
  ![Super Quick Info - C# Color](doc/super-quick-info-csharp-color.png)
  
  The color info not only works in code windows, but also in debugger _Watch_ window.
  
  ![Super Quick Info - Color](doc/super-quick-info-debugger-watch.png)

* **Quick Info size**
  
  From version 7.5 on, it is possible to limit the size of the Quick Info popup, so the window won't cover your whole screen.
  
  By default, _Codist_ does not apply size limitations. You must manually set the _Max width_ and _Max height_ here. If the contents exceed the width, they are wrapped, and scrollbars will appear when necessary, as the screenshot below demonstrates.
  
  ![Super Quick Info - Size](doc/super-quick-info-size.png)

* **Display Delay**

  From version 7.5 on, Codist can delay the display of Quick Info, so it won't get into your way when you move your mouse in the document window.

* **Background**
  
  The background color of the Quick Info can be changed. Click the **Background** button and pick your favorite color.

### C# Quick Info

_Super Quick Info_ especially enhances programming experience for C# programmers. There are plenty of options available in the options page.

<img src="doc/super-quick-info-csharp-options.png" title="" alt="Super Quick Info - Options" width="617">

* **Use enhanced symbol signature style** is a new setting in version 6.6, enabled by default, which optimizes the display of symbol signatures with a reorganized layout. The layout is especially optimized for long and complex signatures, yet ordinary short symbols can also benefit from it. The following is an example for the style. A large icon on the top-left part of the quick info can be clicked and brings out a menu for symbol analysis. Next to the icon is the name of the symbol standing out with larger text. Clicking on the name can jump to its definition. The parameters for the method are listed next. The reorganized layout never breaks the parameter type from its name, so it is easier to find out and locate each parameter type and name. Beneath the signature is the containing type of the symbol, as well the kind of the symbol. And the member type (return value) of the symbol is under the containing type.
  ![C# optimized quick info](doc/csharp-optimized-quick-info.png)

* **Highlight current syntax node in code editor** will draw polygonal markers the syntax node related to the place where Quick Info is triggered.

* A **Context menu** with many symbol analysis commands will show up when you right click the signature of the symbol definition or any symbol that appears in the Super Quick Info.
  
  ![Super Quick Info Csharp Menu](doc/super-quick-info-csharp-menu.png)

* **Override XML Documentation**
  
  The overridden XML Documentation makes the following changes to displayed documentation.
  
  * More syntax colors (adopting syntax highlight colors) for symbols.
  * Icons for documentation parts.
  * Selectable content of the documentation.
  * Copyable quick info content (First select text with your mouse, then press `Ctrl + C` shortcut key, or right click to show up a context menu with Copy command).
  * Concise form of members (without leading namespace or containing type names, hover your mouse over a symbol to view its full definition).
  * Extra tags, such as `<b>` (for bold), `<i>` (for italic) and `<u>` (for underline) are supported.
  * Extra information from documentations (see below).

![Super Quick Info Override Doc](doc/super-quick-info-override-doc.png)

When _Override XML Documentation_ checkbox is checked in the options page, it is also possible to activate options under it.

* **Inherit from base type or interfaces** option will show documentation description from base `class`es or implemented `interface`s if the XML Doc description of the current symbol is absent.
  
  ![Super Quick Info - Inherit Base](doc/super-quick-info-inherit-base.png)

* **Inherit from `<inheritdoc cref="MemberName"/>` target** option will borrow description from the referenced `MemberName`.
  
  ![Super Quick Info Inheritdoc](doc/super-quick-info-inheritdoc.png)

* **Show `<returns>` XML Doc** and **Show `<remarks>` XML Doc** will add content of those tags.

* **Override `<exception>` XML Doc** option adds back documentations for exceptions to the Quick Info.
  
  ![Super Quick Info - Override Exception](doc/super-quick-info-override-exception.png)

_Codist_ shows XML Doc for those `namespace`s with an embedded `NamespaceDoc` class, like what is done in [SandCastle](https://github.com/EWSoftware/SHFB).

 ![Super Quick Info Csharp Namespace](doc/super-quick-info-csharp-namespace.png)

### Additional Quick Info Items

   A dozen of additional quick info items could be displayed in the _Additional Quick Info Items_ options page.

   ![Super Quick Info Csharp Items](doc/super-quick-info-csharp-items.png)

* **Attributes** option shows attributes of a symbol.

* **Base type** and **Interfaces** options shows inheritance and implementation info of a type. It is recommended to check **All ancestor types** and **Inherited interfaces** to display the complete info of the hierarchy of a type.
  
  ![Super Quick Info Attribute Base Interface](doc/super-quick-info-attribute-base-interface.png)
  
  **Note**: the `IDisposable` interface has special importance in .NET programming, thus it is assigned a special icon and pinned to the top of the interface list.

* **Declaration** option shows modifiers to a symbol when it is not a public instance one.
  
  ![Super Quick Info Declaration](doc/super-quick-info-declaration.png)

* **Interface implementation** option shows if a member implements any interface.
  
  ![Super Quick Info Interface Implementation](doc/super-quick-info-interface-implementation.png)

* **Method overload** options shows possible overloads of a method (including applicable extension methods).
  
  ![Super Quick Info - Method Overloads](doc/super-quick-info-method-overloads.png)
  
  This option also helps you find out correct overloads when any argument passed to a method is incorrect.
  
  ![Super Quick Info Param Candidate](doc/super-quick-info-param-candidate.png)

* **Parameter of method** options shows whether a token or an expression is the parameter of a method in the argument list. What is more, the documentation of the parameter is also displayed.
  
  ![Super Quick Info - Param](doc/super-quick-info-param.png)

* **Type parameter** option shows information and documentation about type parameters.

* **Symbol location** shows where a symbol is defined.

* **Numeric forms** shows decimal, hexadecimal and binary forms for constant integer and `Enum` values.
  
  ![Super Quick Info Const](doc/super-quick-info-const.png)
  
  The binary form is useful when working with bit flags.
  
  ![Super Quick Info Enum](doc/super-quick-info-enum.png)

* **String length and Hash codes** for string constants.
  (Hint: We can use Hash codes to quickly compare whether two strings that look alike are identical)

## Navigation Bar

_Navigation bar_ locates at the top of the code editor window. It overrides the original navigation bar. When the _Navigation Bar_ is loaded, it hides two drop-down lists on the original Navigation Bar, but preserves the project drop-down list.

Basically, the _Navigation Bar_ serves the same purpose of the original one comes with Visual Studio, displaying symbol information where the caret is placed.

  ![Navigation Bar Overview](doc/navigation-bar-overview.png)

  **Note**: Navigation Bar works with both C# code documents and Markdown documents.

  Nodes on the _Navigation Bar_ are clickable.

1. Clicking on the left-most **Search Document node** will popup a menu, displaying namespaces and types defined in the active document.
   
   On top of the menu, there is a **Search Declaration** box, within which you can type and search declarations.
   
   ![Navigation Bar Namespace Types](doc/navigation-bar-search.png)
   
   Besides the _Search Declaration_ box, there are three buttons. The first one is pressed by default, which restricts the search scope to active document. If the second one is pressed, it pops up the first button and expands the search scope to current project (see screen shot below). The third button clears the search box and reverts the items back to unfiltered namespaces and types.
   
   **Note**: Press `-` or `=` key on keyboard to switch search scope between current document and current project.
   
   ![Navigation Bar Search Declaration](doc/navigation-bar-search-declaration.png)
   
   **Note**: If the first character in the search box is an upper case one, the search will be **case-sensitive**, otherwise, it is case-insensitive.
   
   You can **drag and drop** items in the menu to reorder types within the document.

2. Clicking on the **global namespace node**, which has a house as the icon, will popup a menu, displaying all root namespaces defined in the project and referenced assemblies, as well as types without any namespace. You can click namespaces to check out its sub-namespaces and types.
   
   ![Global namespaces](doc/navigation-bar-global-namespaces.png)
   
   There is also a search box in this menu, which filters content of the menu.
   
   There are several buttons beside the search box. Numbers on the buttons counts corresponding items within the type. Hover your mouse cursor over the button, you can read meanings of them. Pressing down those buttons filters members within the menu to corresponding ones.
   
   You can right click items on the menu to bring out a context menu for corresponding members.

3. Clicking a **Namespace node** which follows the Document node will popup a menu, displaying namespaces and types defined in the corresponding namespace. You can click on those items and jump to the beginning of corresponding definitions.

4. Clicking on a **Type node** will popup a menu, displaying members and regions defined within the type. You can click on those items and jump to the definition of the corresponding member.
   
   You can **drag and drop** items in the menu to reorder members, nested types and `#region`s within the document. If a `partial` type spans over several code files, it is also possible to rearrange members among them.
   
   ![Navigation Bar Fields](doc/navigation-bar-fields.png)
   
   The current symbol where the caret is on is highlighted.
   
   Field values and auto-property expressions are also displayed on this menu. So, you can read the initial value of fields immediately.
   
   You can right click items to bring out a context menu for the symbol.
   
   ![Navigation Bar Fields](doc/navigation-bar-context-menu.png)
   
   5. Clicking on a **Member node** will select the whole member. If you have the _Smart Bar_ feature on and let it appear when selection is changed, _Smart Bar_ will be displayed and let you perform actions onto the member.
      
      ![Navigation Bar Select](doc/navigation-bar-select.png)

### Customization

  The _Navigation Bar_ can be configure via the options page.

![Navigation Bar Options](doc/navigation-bar-options.png)

* If **Syntax detail** option is set, the _Navigation Bar_ not only shows available types and declarations in the code window like the original navigation bar, but also syntax nodes such as statements and expressions containing the caret.
  
  ![Navigation Bar Syntax Details](doc/navigation-bar-syntax-details.png)

* If **Symbol info tip** option is set, you can read information about a symbol when you hover your mouse onto a node.
  
  ![Navigation Bar Symbol Info](doc/navigation-bar-symbol-info.png)

* If **Highlight syntax range** option is set, when you hover the mouse over the node on the bar, corresponding span of the node will be highlighted in the editor.
  
  ![Navigation Bar Node Range](doc/navigation-bar-node-range.png)
  
  * If **Region** option is set, `#region` names will be displayed on the Navigation Bar. If you pad region names with some non-alphabetic characters like "`#region [====== private methods ======]`", you can check the **Trim non-letter characters in region** checkbox so only alphabetic part like "`private methods`" will be displayed on the _Navigation Bar_.
  
  To customize drop-down menus of the _Navigation Bar,_ change options in the _Drop-down Menu_ tab.

### Markdown Navigation Bar

The Markdown navigation bar lists all titles appear in a Markdown document.

  ![Navigation Bar Markdown](doc/navigation-bar-markdown.png)

Similarly, you can type in the search box to filter down the titles.

## Smart Bar

  The *Smart Bar* is a context-aware tool bar that appears automatically when you select some text, or double tap the _Shift_ key on your keyboard.

  There are two toolbars on _Smart Bar_. The top bar contains general editing commands for all file types. Buttons on the bottom bar changes according to file types.

Buttons on the *Smart Bar* changes according to your selection, typical buttons are editing operations (e.g. _Cut_, _Copy_, _Paste_,  _Delete_, _Duplicate_, _Formatting_, _Find_, etc.), code analysis operations (e.g. _Go to definition_, _Find references_), refactoring operations (e.g. _Rename_, _Extract method_, etc.)

  ![Smart Bar](doc/smart-bar.png)

  Each button on _Smart Bar_ usually has multiple functions. Left clicking, right clicking, Ctrl+clicking and Shift+clicking trigger different commands. For details, see the tool-tip for the buttons. Right clicking a button usually expands the effective range of a command to the whole line, or brings out a pop-up menu for more commands.

  ![Smart Bar](doc/smart-bar-2.png)

There are multiple predefined **web search** commands in the menu when you right click the Find button, which will launch your browser to search the text you select in document window. So, it is handier to look for answers from the web or find code examples in _GitHub_.

  ![Smart Bar Search](doc/smart-bar-search.png)

You can specify what browser you prefer to use in the options page.

![Smart Bar Search Options](doc/smart-bar-search-options.png)

### C# Specific Commands

  When you select a symbol, you may probably see a _Smart Bar_ like below.

  ![Smart Bar](doc/smart-bar.png)

  The C# commands are on the second row.

The first one is **Go to Definition**, that behaves the same as the keyboard `F12` command. With this, you no longer need hitting the `F12` key to go to definition.

The second one is the **Analyze symbol...** button, a menu will pop up showing possible symbol analysis commands for the symbol. Since some commands require considerable amount of calculation, items ending with "..." will require a mouse click to expand. For instance, clicking the **Find Callers** command in the following screen shot will search the source code and list at what places are calling the selected method in a symbol list. In the symbol list, you can filter items like the what you can do in the _Navigation Bar_, click items on the sub-menu and jump to the corresponding location.

  ![Smart Bar Symbol Analysis](doc/smart-bar-symbol-analysis.png)

Various commands will be conditionally listed under the **Analyze symbol...** menu. Here is a list of commands for an interface.

  ![Smart Bar Symbol Analysis 2](doc/smart-bar-symbol-analysis-2.png)

The **Find Members** command under **Analyze symbol...** lists all members defined within a type. For some special types, for instance, `SystemColors`, `Colors`, `Brushes`, etc. The preview is shown on the list.

  ![Smart Bar Member Colors](doc/smart-bar-member-colors.png)

For Visual Studio extension developers, the preview offers more, for instances, it allows previewing images of `KnownImageIds`, colors in `VsBrush`, etc.

  ![Smart Bar Member KnownImageIds](doc/smart-bar-member-knownimageids.png)

The **Find Implementations** command for an interface type will display all types that implement that interface. The same command will also appear for interface members, which finds out corresponding members that implement the specific interface member.

When we begin to work with new libraries, we usually have to learn new types and APIs. Two typical scenario are that "_what methods, properties return specific instance of a type?_" and "_what methods can an instance of a given type can be passed into?_". Thus, _Smart Bar_ provides _Find Instance Producer_ and _Find Instance as Parameter_ for type names. The following screen shot demonstrates the result of finding instance producers which returns an instance of `IWpfTextView`.

  ![Smart Bar Instance Producer](doc/smart-bar-instance-producer.png)

There are two buttons on the top right corner in the result list of symbol analysis commands. The _Pin_ button will keep the list on the screen. And you can use your mouse to drag those lists around.

### Code Refactorings

From version 7.0 on, quite a few code refactorings are provided via a button on the C# Smart Bar.

  ![Smart Bar Code Refactoring](doc/smart-bar-refactoring.png)

You can access the menu from keyboard by assigning a shortcut key to the `Refactor.RefactoringCode` command.

### Symbol Marker

_Symbol marker_ draws markers for C# symbols.

Typically, you can double click a symbol in the C# source code, select the *Mark Symbol* command on the *Smart Bar* and choose the desired highlight marker on the drop-down menu.

  ![Symbol Marker](doc/symbolmarker.png)

After applying the command, all occurrences of the marked symbol will be marked with a different style.

  ![Symbol Marker Effect](doc/symbolmarker-effect.png)

To remove symbol marker, click the *Remove symbol mark* command in the drop-down menu of the *Mark symbol* command.

Symbol markers will be cleared when the solution is unloaded.

**Note**: The style of symbol markers can be customized in the *Syntax highlight Configurations* dialog. The default colors are listed below. You also need to turn on the _Syntax Highlight_ feature in order to make this feature work.

  ![Symbol marker Options](doc/symbolmarker-options.png)

### Behavior of Smart Bar

By default, _Smart Bar_ appears after selection changes, you can alter the behavior in the options page by unchecking the _Show Smart Bar when selection is changed_ checkbox.

![Smart Bar Options](doc/smart-bar-options.png)

_Smart Bar_ automatically disappears when you move your mouse cursor away from it, or execute a certain commands on the _Smart Bar_, or click somewhere else in the code editor window, emptying the selection.

  To make the _Smart Bar_ reappear, you can tap the `Shift` key on your keyboard twice within a second. This behavior can also be suppressed by unchecking the **Show/hide Smart Bar with Shift key** checkbox.

### Smart Bar in Other Windows

_Smart Bar_ also works on _Output_, _C# Interactive_, _Immediate (Debug)_, _Find Results_ and some other text selectable window panes. If you select a path within those windows, extra commands will pop up allowing you to open it directly or locate it in _Windows Explorer_.

  ![Smart Bar File Operations](doc/smart-bar-file-operations.png)

## Scrollbar Marker

_Scrollbar Marker_ draws extra glyphs and shapes on the vertical scrollbar for the following syntax elements:

* **Line numbers** (marked with gray dashed lines and numbers, from version 7.4 on, total line count is displayed at the bottom of the scroll bar)
* Selection range (marked with semi-transparent color blocks over the bar)
* Special comments tagged by comment tagger (marked with small squares)
* C# `class`/`struct`/`interface`/`enum` **declarations** (marked with lines indicating their ranges and a square, and their names indicating their declaration locations)
* C# compiler directives, e.g. `#if`, `#else`, `#region`, `#pragma`, etc. (marked with a gray spot)
* C# symbol match marker (matches symbol under the caret, marked with an aqua square)

Please see the first screenshot of this article. The markers can be toggled via the options page.

![Scrollbar Marker Options](doc/scrollbar-marker-options.png)

## Auto Changing Version Numbers

Codist can automatically change version numbers for output assemblies before build.

To activate the behavior, right click the project in the Solution Explorer and select the _Auto Build Version Numbers..._ command.

  ![Auto Build Version](doc/auto-version.png)

On the left side of the dialog, build configurations are listed. "\<Any>" configuration applies to all build configuration scenarios. Others applies to the corresponding scenarios respectively.

On the right side of the dialog, current version numbers are listed. And four drop-down list controls specify the behavior how version number parts are changed.

Once you change the drop-down list control to a value rather than "Unchanged", the new version number will be displayed next to the current version number as a preview how it will be changed before next build.

Press the "Save" button to save the settings and Codist will change build numbers for you before future builds.

**Note**: The build settings are saved in the _obj_ folder where the project file locates.

## Display Enhancements

In the *Display* tab of the *General* options page, several display enhancement options are offered.

<img src="doc/display-options.png" title="" alt="General Options Display" width="783">

Within the *Extra line margins* group box, you can adjust margins between lines to make code lines more readable.

Programmers who do not like *ClearType* rendering, which made text blurry and colorful, may want to try _Force Grayscale Text Rendering_ options.

From version 6.6 on, resource monitors can be used to monitorCPU, disk and memory usage via the status bar on Visual Studio. Checking the *Monitor CPU*, *Monitor disk* or _Monitor memory_ check box enables the corresponding monitors.

![Resource Monitors](doc/resource-monitors.png)

It is possible to use Compact menu like _Visual Studio 2019_ in _Visual Studio 2017_. Simply checking the _Move main menu to title bar_ option will do.

![Compact Menu](doc/compact-menu.png)

By checking the check boxes started with "Hide...", it is possible to hide some elements from the user interface of Visual Studio from options under the _Layout Override_ section.

## Jump List Shortcuts

Jump List is a menu section that appears when you right click the Visual Studio button on the task bar. It lists your recently opened solutions, projects or documents.

If you are using Open-Shell or other similar Start Menu applications, Codist can add three shortcuts to the Quick Start list of Visual Studio when you check the _Jump List Shortcuts_ option. Those shortcuts start Visual Studio in a special mode.

1. *Non-scaling mode*: disables DPI-awareness of Visual Studio and let you design WinForm applications with 100% scaling.
2. *Safe mode*: disables most extensions in Visual Studio. If an extension keeps crashing the development environment, you can use the Safe mode to enter Visual Studio to disable or uninstall it.
3. *Presentation mode*: opens a particular instance of Visual Studio which has its own settings and layouts.

## Auto Pair Punctuations

From version 7.6 on, Codist can automatically "pair" punctuations around selections.

To make this work, follow the steps below:
1. Check the _Auto Pair Punctuation_ option in the option page, which is off by default.
2. Select some text in the code editor.
3. Type an "opening" punctuation, for instance, `(`, `<`, `{`, `[`, `"` or `'`.
4. When this option is turned off, the typed character will replace the selection; when this option is turned on, typed character will be inserted in front of the selection, and their counterpart--that is, `)`, `>`, `}`, `]`, `"` or `'`--will be appended behind the selection. For example, if you select `abc` in the code, and type `"`, you will get `"abc"`; if you select `x + y` in the code, and type `(`, you will get `(x + y)`.
5. Once the first character is typed,
   a. If you actually want the typed character to replace the selection, press the _Delete_ or _Backspace_ key, the selection and the automatically inserted counterpart will be erased;
   b. If more characters are to be inserted after the first character, just keep typing, the not-yet-removed content as well as the punctuation counterpart will be replaced.
   c. If the automatically inserted paired punctuation is what you need, that is what you get now.
6. When we edit Markdown documents, the <tt>\`</tt>, `*`, `_` and `~` are also auto-paired.
7. For Chinese users, Chinese full width punctuations are also auto-paired.

You can always turn off this feature by unchecking the _Auto Pair Punctuation_ option in the option page.

## Codist in Your Language

It is possible to localize _Codist_ to other language. Simplified Chinese (简体中文) and English are provided by default.

The interface of _Codist_ will change according to the _International_ settings of _Visual Studio_.

## Other Features

From version 7.4 on, extra menu commands to open build output target folder are added to the _Build_ menu.

It is possible to output a time stamp after each build.

For VSIX developers, there is also an option to automatically increment version number for your VSIX manifest file.

# Feature Control

Open the *Codist* section in the *Tools->Options* dialog. In the *General* section you can toggle features of *Codist*.

![General customization](doc/general-options.png)

1. *Feature controllers* contains check boxes which can be used to enable/disable features of *Codist*.
   
   Someone who does not like the syntax highlight or use another syntax highlighter can also turn off the *Syntax Highlight* feature individually here.
   
   These **options will take effect on new document windows**. Existing document windows won't be affected.

2. To share or backup your settings of Codist, you can use the *Save* and *Load* buttons.
